## CS370 - Emerging Trends

The project was to take a maze, train an agent to navigate the maze to get from start to the end. We were given a project template with Python code to manage the maze and manage the agent. I completed the template by providing the code to implement the Q-Training algorithm. The algorithm initializes starting state, guesses a move either with prediction or exploration, updates the state/reward from the move, then updates the model by fitting the decision against a random sample of history. Afterwards the accuracy is calculated. When the game finishes with either a win or loss, the process starts over until the model gets good enough to win nearly 100% of the time. 

Machine learning and artificial intelligence are important parts of computer science. The models employed are instrumental in predicting outcomes based upon large amounts of data without resorting to hand-coding each particule case. 

Computer scientists collect, organize, manage, operate over, and distribute data, thereby automating tasks that save hours of work from users. 

I approach my job as a computer scientist by gathering information about what is required, plan a solution, and breakdown implementation into achievable tasks. Each task is scheduled and assigned to capable people with care taken to manage and minimize risks and delays to the project. The project is delivered and maintained to ensure it operates with minimal costs.

My ethical responsibiliteis as a computer scientist are to ensure privacy of the user and organization are protected, as well as ensure that reasonable steps are taken to prevent financial, physical, and emotional harm.
